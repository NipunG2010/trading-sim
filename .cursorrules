# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.


# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- When searching for recent news, use the current year (2025) instead of previous years, or simply use the "recent" keyword to get the latest information
- When working with Solana, use @solana/web3.js and @solana/spl-token libraries for token creation and transactions
- For TypeScript projects, ensure @types/node is installed for Node.js functionality
- When creating Solana transactions, ensure the wallet has sufficient SOL before attempting to create tokens or perform transactions
- Use JavaScript files directly instead of TypeScript when encountering module resolution issues
- For Solana devnet, accounts need to be funded with SOL before they can be used for transactions
- Batch Solana transactions with delays to avoid rate limiting issues
- Use proper error handling for Solana transactions to catch and display meaningful error messages
- When using ES modules in TypeScript/JavaScript, include the .js extension in import statements even for TypeScript files
- The Token class from @solana/spl-token has been deprecated - use the newer functional approach with methods like getMint, getAccount, etc. instead
